Cannoli Fund About Page- README

This is the README file for the Cannoli Fund website about page. Here you'll find information about the website's structure, functionality, and included files.

Website Purpose:

This website serves as an online presence for the Cannoli Fund, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping dogs and cats in the King William and Lavaca areas.

Website Structure:

    index.html: The main page of the website.
    globals.css: Styles applied globally across the website.
    style.css: Styles specific to this webpage.
    img/ folder:* Contains images used throughout the website.

HTML Breakdown:

    The website utilizes a single HTML file (index.html) to structure the content.
    The content is divided into sections using HTML elements like <header>, <main>, <footer>, <nav>, etc.
    Each news block (<news-1>, <news-2>, etc.) showcases information about Cannoli Fund activities.
    The navigation bar (<nav>) provides links to different sections of the website.

Images:

    The website utilizes various images located in the img folder.
    Ensure these images are included in your project when deploying the website.

CSS Files:

    Two CSS files (globals.css and style.css) define the website's visual style.
    These files are linked in the <head> section of the HTML document.

Functionality:

    The website is primarily informational, showcasing Cannoli Fund's past activities and donation options.

Deployment:

    To deploy this website, you'll need to upload the index.html file, the CSS files (globals.css and style.css), and the img folder (containing all images) to a web server.

Additional Notes:

    This is a basic website and might not include complex functionalities like user interaction or forms.
    If you encounter any broken links or missing images, ensure the relative paths in the HTML file are correct compared to your folder structure.

I hope this README provides a clear understanding of the Cannoli Fund website's structure and content. Feel free to modify the HTML and CSS files to customize the website further.
